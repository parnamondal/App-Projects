# Music-Player-App
The repository contains the app projects developed by me. 
It's a fascinating Music Player App which has play , pause , update etc. features included .
One of the interesting feature is it displays all the songs present in your device 

It's developed with 
• Android Studio
• XML
• JAVA 8
 Below there are some screenshoots attached for better clarity :
